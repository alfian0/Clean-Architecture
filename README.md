## Overview
This Xcode template provides a starting point for SwiftUI projects that adhere to Clean Architecture principles. Clean Architecture, developed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes separation of concerns, making your codebase more maintainable and scalable. This template structures your project to follow these principles, facilitating a more organized approach to app development.

## Features
1. Project Structure:
   - **Layered Architecture:** The template organizes your project into distinct layers, such as Presentation, Domain, and Data. This separation helps in isolating different aspects of the application and ensures that changes in one layer do not impact others.
   - **Presentation Layer:** Contains SwiftUI views and view models. It handles the user interface and user interactions.
   - **Domain Layer:** Includes business logic and domain entities. It defines the core functionality of the application and contains use cases and protocols.
   - **Data Layer:** Manages data operations, including network requests, local storage, and data persistence. It interacts with external sources and provides data to the domain layer.
2. Dependency Injection:
   - The template incorporates dependency injection to manage dependencies between different layers. This approach enhances testability and reduces tight coupling between components.
3. SwiftUI Integration:
   - The template leverages SwiftUI for building user interfaces, aligning with modern iOS development practices. It sets up the necessary infrastructure for integrating SwiftUI views with the clean architecture layers.
4. Best Practices:
   - **Separation of Concerns:** The template enforces a clear separation of responsibilities among different layers of the architecture.
   - **Modularity:** Promotes modular design, allowing individual components to be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
   - **Testability:** The architecture is designed to be test-friendly, making it easier to write unit tests and ensure code quality.
5. Code Organization:
   - Provides a well-organized folder structure and sample code to demonstrate how to implement clean architecture principles in SwiftUI projects.
   - Includes example implementations and boilerplate code to get you started quickly.

## Benefits
- **Maintainability:** By adhering to Clean Architecture, the template helps in keeping the codebase maintainable and easy to understand.
- **Scalability:** The modular structure supports scaling the application by adding new features or components without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Testability:** Facilitates writing unit tests for different layers, ensuring that each part of the application can be tested in isolation.

This template is especially useful for developers who want to build robust and scalable SwiftUI applications while adhering to best practices in software design.
